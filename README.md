trust, and human responsibility at its core.

## Who this is for
- Systems engineers
- Security researchers
- AI researchers who care about control
- Students who want to understand adaptive systems deeply

## Prerequisites
- Basic C/C++ knowledge
- Understanding of OS concepts
- Curiosity and responsibility
