# What is Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC)?

Adaptive Intelligence Circle is a system-level approach to AI
where intelligence is allowed to adapt only under strict observation,
introspection, and enforcement.

AIC treats AI as:
- A subsystem
- A potentially dangerous component
- Something that must be monitored, explained, and constrained

This is fundamentally different from agent-based AI systems.
